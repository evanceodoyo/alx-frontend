# Advanced HTML

This project focuses on how to use (semantic) HTML tags to structure a web page. The files build on top of each other upto to the final file. For example, [1-index.html](./1-index.html)continues to build from where [1-index.html](./0-index.html) stopped and so on upto the final [index.html](./index.html). The same applies to the `*-styleguide.html` files.

The [images](./images/) used are downloaded from:
- [UI Faces](https://www.uifaces.co/) - for avatars.
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) - for other images.
